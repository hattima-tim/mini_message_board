# mini_message_board

Built as an assignment for [The Odin Project](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum) .

Details of the assignment can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-mini-message-board) .

See the project live [here](https://mini-message-board-hattima-tim.onrender.com/) . The app may load slowly because it is using free tier of render (hosting provider) and so, the app is put to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity.

The goal of this project was to build an app using backend technologies like nodejs, express, mongoose, pug. So, the frontend looks very basic. Sorry for that, if you were looking for some shiny apps :')

# Technology used

- Nodejs
- Express
- Mongoose
- Pug

# What the app does?

The app allows users to post messages with their names and the date the message was added. The messages are stored in mongodb and the app renders the messages on the main page.
